A easy way to implement and write Selenium with TypeScript using Deno 🦕

## Features

- Easy handling on driver side web browser to isolate each test ✅.
- Get a daily log file to check all test process if passed or failed ✅.
- Export each test case inside the reports ✅.

## Configuration

Create a drowser.json in root directory and define some configuration like this:

- `url`: The url of platform or website that need to be test

```json
{
  "url": "http://url_of_the_platform_need_to_be_tested"
}
```

## Deno 2

Install npm dependecies on `node_modules` with this command:

```sh
deno install --allow-scripts
```

## Usage

In test file , Define a sample test like this:

With this test we only test this sample code inside a Chrome ,Firefox but create a test for another web browser like Edge, Safari 🚀

```ts
import { driver } from "https://deno.land/x/drowser@v0.1.6/mod.ts";

driver({ browser: "chrome" })
  .then(({ service }) => {
    service.cases = [
      {
        name: "Verify Failed Title",
        fn: async ({ builder, assert }) => {
          const title = await builder.getTitle();
          assert.assertEquals(title, "Drowsers");
        },
      },
      {
        name: "Verify Title",
        fn: async ({ builder, assert }) => {
          const title = await builder.getTitle();
          assert.assertEquals(title, "Drowser");
        },
      },
    ];
  })
  .catch((error) => console.log(error));

driver({ browser: "firefox" })
  .then(({ service }) => {
    service.cases = [
      {
        name: "Verify Failed Title",
        fn: async ({ builder, assert }) => {
          const title = await builder.getTitle();
          assert.assertEquals(title, "Drowsers");
        },
      },
      {
        name: "Verify Title",
        fn: async ({ builder, assert }) => {
          const title = await builder.getTitle();
          assert.assertEquals(title, "Drowser");
        },
      },
    ];
  })
  .catch((error) => console.log(error));
```

## Drowser Studio

> Note: The `Drowser Studio` is a community-driven project and is open-source.

Each test case is saved inside the `drowser-reports.json` file , and this file is exploitable inside the `Drowser Studio` who is developed by the `Kinotio` Team in this [repo](https://github.com/kinotio/drowser-studio) , who is open-source

Import this reports inside of the studio to visualize all the metrics for main cases or each test case

## Report

The `drowser-reports.json` file provides a comprehensive overview of the test execution metrics and individual test case details. This file is generated after running your tests and can be used to analyze the results and performance of your test suite.

You can import the `drowser-reports.json` file into the [Drowser Studio](https://drowser.kinotio.io/) to visualize and analyze the metrics for each test case. This helps in identifying issues, understanding test coverage, and improving the overall quality of your test suite.

For more details on how to use [Drowser Studio](https://drowser.kinotio.io/), refer to the [Drowser Studio Repository](https://github.com/kinotio/drowser-studio).
